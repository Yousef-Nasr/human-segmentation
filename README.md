# Selfie-segmentation

#### This dataset is split into 1700 training samples and 300 testing samples, stored in "training" and "testing" folders respectively. Each image has a unique identifier (not unique across testing and training, though) and can be used to easily retrieve its corresponding matte/segmentation. The segmentation are only binary -- foreground and background.
